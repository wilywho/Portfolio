# Project Description
This project involves building and comparing the performance of Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the State of Charge (SOC) in batteries. The dataset consists of features like Time, Voltage, Capacity, and Energy Density, with SOC as the target variable. The data was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets, followed by standardization to ensure uniform scaling.

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Development:
DNN Model: A sequential model with two hidden layers was built and trained.
LSTM Model: A sequential model using LSTM layers was designed to capture time-series dependencies.
Model Training: Both models were trained on the dataset using the Adam optimizer, and their performance was evaluated using metrics like R2 score, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Performance Evaluation: The models were compared based on their ability to predict SOC accurately, with the LSTM model slightly outperforming the DNN model in terms of MAE and MAPE.
Results:
DNN Performance:
R2: 0.9999995
RMSE: 0.0204
MAE: 0.0178
MAPE: 0.5094%
LSTM Performance:
R2: 0.9999994
RMSE: 0.0220
MAE: 0.0160
MAPE: 0.4729%
Both models demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities, with the LSTM model showing a slight edge in handling the time-series nature of the data. This project showcases the effective application of deep learning models in battery SOC prediction, providing a foundation for further exploration and optimization in this domain.
