Netflix Review Sentiment Analysis 📊
Welcome to my Netflix Review Sentiment Analysis project! This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and clustering algorithms to analyze and classify user reviews from Netflix. Here’s an overview of what this project entails:

Project Highlights 🌟
Dataset: Analyzed a comprehensive dataset containing features like reviewId, userName, content, score, thumbsUpCount, reviewCreatedVersion, at, and appVersion.
Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed textual data, including lowercasing, removing non-alphanumeric characters, and converting emojis to text.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Employed TF-IDF to convert text data into meaningful numerical features.
Clustering: Used K-Means clustering to group reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applied techniques like PCA and t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional data.
Sentiment Classification: Built and evaluated a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, achieving an accuracy of 82%.
Key Results 📈
Accuracy: 82%
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Demonstrated strong performance in classifying sentiment with a balanced precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization 🎨
Clustering Visuals: Generated scatter plots and histograms to visualize clusters and sentiment distribution.
Dimensionality Reduction: Plotted 2D and 3D projections of high-dimensional data.
Conclusion 📝
This project showcases the application of NLP and machine learning techniques in analyzing user sentiment from textual reviews. It highlights the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a valuable portfolio piece for aspiring data scientists and NLP enthusiasts.
